GENERAL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS for OSPD-BASED SCANNERS
--------------------------------------------------

This is a general description about how to use an
ospd-based scanner wrapper implementation.

The actual scanner implementation has a individual
README instruction for anything that goes beyond
this general guide.

In the following description replace "scanner" by the name
of the actual OSPD scanner.

See the INSTALL of your ospd-based scanner and the general
instructions in file ospd/doc/INSTALL-ospd-scanner on how to
hand over full control to the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager.

This usage guide explains how to use an OSP scanner independently
from Greenbone Vulnerability Manager, for example when developing
a new ospd-based scanner or for testing purposes.


Open Scanner Protocol
---------------------

Using a ospd-based scanner means to use the Open Scanner Protocol
(OSP). This is what Greenbone Vulnerability Manager does.
See the ospd module for the original specification (ospd/doc/OSP.xml).

There is also an online version available at:

  http://docs.greenbone.net/API/OSP/osp.html


gvm-tools
---------

The gvm-tools help to make accessing the OSP interface easier.
They can be obtained from

  https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools

This module provides the commands gvm-cli and gvm-pyshell.


Starting an ospd-based scanner
------------------------------

All ospd-based scanners share a set of command-line options such as
--help, --bind-address, --port, --key-file, --timeout etc.

For example to see the command line options you can run

$ ospd-scanner --help


To run a test instance of ospd-scanner on unix socket:

$ ospd-scanner -u <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock &

To run a test instance of ospd-scanner on local port 1234:

$ ospd-scanner -b 127.0.0.1 -p 1234 &

Add "--log-level=DEBUG" to enable maximum debugging output.

Parameter for --log-level can be one of debug, info, warnings, error, or
critical (in order of priority).


Controlling an OSP scanner
--------------------------

You can use command line tools of "gvm-tools" module to interact with an OSP
scanner.

To get a description of the interface:

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml "<help/>"


Starting a scan (scanner parameters can be added according to the description
printed upon the command "<help/>"):

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com'></start_scan>"


Start a scan for ospd-based scanners that use the builtin-support for ssh authentication:

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com' ports=''><scanner_params><username_password>myuser:mypassword</username_password></scanner_params></start_scan>"


Start a scan for two vulnerability tests vt_id_1 and vt_id_2 of a ospd-based scanner:

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com'><scanner_params></scanner_params><vts>vt_id_1, vt_id_2</vts></start_scan>"


Show the list of scans with status and results:

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml="<get_scans/>"


Delete a scan from this list (only finished scans can be deleted):

$ gvm-cli socket --sockpath <prefix>/var/run/ospd-scanner.sock --xml="<delete_scan scan_id='013587e3-b4d7-8e79-9ebb-90a2133c338c'/>"
